It's common to use code like `{{ settings.headline_color }}` as value of css property in css file of shopify theme. It cause some annoying issues since it's a invalid value of css. For exmaple, your code editor will lost syntax highlighting.
With this simple plugin, you can use code like `$headline_color` instead. It will be transformed to the syntax shopify support.",
